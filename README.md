# PyFIT
PyFIT is a library that allows reading .FIT files from Garmin devices into Python.


### How do I get started ###
* First, you will need to download the FIT SDK file https://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit/. In there, you will find a Profile.xlsx that has the necessary information on how to generate the source code
* Generate the the files, use scr_fit_code_generator and adjust it to your directory setup
* You are now ready to go and read some FIT files. Take a look at scr_fit_reader for how to do that


### Who do I talk to? ###
* If you have any questions, please, feel free to reach out to: Joan Puig at <joan.puig@gmail.com>
